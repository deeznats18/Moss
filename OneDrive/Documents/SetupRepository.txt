GitHub Test Repo Setup Summary
Created a local Git repository using git init.

Added a placeholder file (Zombie Draw Deck Images.docx) to test Git functionality.

Committed the file with a message like "Initial commit".

Created a remote GitHub repository named Moss under your account frazierross231-lgtm.

Linked your local repo to GitHub using:

bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/frazierross231-lgtm/Moss.git
Resolved a remote error by verifying the URL and repo existence.

Successfully pushed your test commit to the master branch.

ðŸ”® Future Plans for the Repo
You plan to replace the placeholder with:

README files to document your project

Python and Bash scripts for actual functionality

Let me know when you're ready to scaffold your README or want help structuring your codebase. I can help with everything from CLI tools to automation scripts. Want to sketch out what Moss will eventually do?
